The Kubernetes controller __Cleaner__ identifies, removes, or updates stale/orphaned or unhealthy resources to maintain a clean and efficient Kubernetes cluster. It is designed to handle any Kubernetes resource types (including your own custom resources) and provides sophisticated filtering capabilities, including label-based selection and custom Lua-based criteria.
__Cleaner__ can also be used to identify unhealthy resources.

k8s-cleaner keeps you in the loop with handy notifications through:

Currently k8s-cleaner has rich set of working examples to **identify** and **list** **unused**:

- [ConfigMaps](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/configmaps)/[Secrets](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/secrets)
- [ClusterRoles](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/clusterroles)/[Roles](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/roles)
- [ServiceAccounts](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/service-accounts)
- [PersistentVolumes](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/persistent-volumes)/[PersistentVolumeClaims](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/persistent-volume-claims)
- [Deployments](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/deployments)/[StatefulSets](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/stateful-sets)
- [Identify resources based on annotation indicating the maximum lifespan or the expiration date](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unused-resources/time_based_delete)
- More

There are also examples to identify unhealthy resources:

  - [Pods Mounting Secrets with Old Content](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unhealthy-resources/pod-with-outdated-secrets): Detect pods that are not utilizing the most recent Secret data.
  - [Pods Using Expired Certificates](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/tree/main/examples-unhealthy-resources/pod-with-expired-certificates): Pinpoint pods that are operating with expired security certificates.

## Features and Capabilities

1Ô∏è‚É£ [**Schedule**](https://gianlucam76.github.io/k8s-cleaner/getting_started/features/schedule/schedule/): Specify the frequency at which the k8s-cleaner should scan the cluster and identify stale resources. Utilise the Cron syntax to define recurring schedules.

2Ô∏è‚É£ [**DryRun**](https://gianlucam76.github.io/k8s-cleaner/getting_started/features/dryrun/dryrun/): Enable safe testing of the k8s-cleaner filtering logic without affecting actual resource configurations. Resources matching the criteria will get identified, but no changes will get applied.

3Ô∏è‚É£ [**Label Filtering**](https://gianlucam76.github.io/k8s-cleaner/getting_started/features/label_filters/label_filters/): Select resources based on user-defined labels, filtering out unwanted or outdated components. Refine the selection based on label key, operation (equal, different, etc.), and value.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Lua-based Selection Criteria**: Leverage the [Lua](https://lua.org/) scripting language to create complex and dynamic selection criteria, catering to specific resource management needs. Define custom logic to identify and handle stale resources. To validate the Cleaner configuration, have a look [here](#validate-the-cleaner-configuration).

5Ô∏è‚É£ [**Notifications**](https://gianlucam76.github.io/k8s-cleaner/notifications/notifications/): Stay informed! The k8s-cleaner keeps users in the loop about every cleaned-up resource, whether removed or optimized. Get detailed notification lists and pick your preferred channel: Slack, Webex, Discord, Teams, Telegram, SMTP or reports.

For a complete list of **features** with **examples**, have a look at the [link](https://gianlucam76.github.io/k8s-cleaner/getting_started/features/dryrun/dryrun/).

## Benefits

üí™ **Resource Removal**: Efficiently remove stale resources from your cluster, reclaiming unused resources and improving resource utilisation.

üí™ **Resource Updates**: Update outdated resources to ensure they align with the latest configurations and maintain consistent functionality.

üí™ **Reduced Resource Bloat**: Minimize resource bloat and maintain a clean and organized cluster, improving overall performance and stability.

By combining the **flexibility** of **scheduling**, the **accuracy** of **label filtering**, the **power** of **Lua-based criteria**, and the ability to **remove** or **update** stale resources, the k8s-cleaner empowers users to effectively manage Kubernetes environments and optimise resource usage.

## Getting Started Guide

- üìñ  [Complete Documentation](http://k8scleaner.projectsveltos.io/)

## Install on Multiple Clusters with Sveltos

If you manage a fleet of Kubernetes clusters, [Sveltos](https://github.com/projectsveltos) simplifies the deployment and management of k8s-cleaner across your entire infrastructure. Instead of manually deploying k8s-cleaner to each cluster, Sveltos offers a centralized platform to:

- **Automate Deployment**: Easily deploy k8s-cleaner to multiple clusters with a single configuration.
- **Manage Configurations**: Centrally manage k8s-cleaner configurations and apply them consistently across all clusters.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain consistent k8s-cleaner configurations and versions across your fleet.

Detailed information can be found [here](https://gianlucam76.github.io/k8s-cleaner/getting_started/install/install_on_multiple_cluster/).

## Validate Cleaner Configuration

To verify the correctness of the __Cleaner__ configuration, follow the comprehensive instructions provided in the documentation: [here](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/blob/main/internal/controller/executor/validate_transform/README.md) and [here](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner/blob/main/internal/controller/executor/validate_transform/README.md).

In essence, the Cleaner YAML file alongside the YAML files representing matching and non-matching resources need to get provided, and then by executing the simple ```make ut``` command the resutls will appear. This will validate whether your configuration correctly identifies and manages the desired resources.

## Contribute

We encourage everyone to contribute to the example directory by adding new Cleaner configurations üí°. This will help the community benefit from different expertise and build a stronger knowledge base of the Cleaner use cases.

To add an example, simply create a new file in the example directory with a descriptive name and put your Cleaner configuration within the file. Once you've added your example, feel free to submit a pull request to share it with the community.

ü§ù Together we can expand the range of Cleaner applications and make it an even more valuable tool for managing Kubernetes resources efficiently.
